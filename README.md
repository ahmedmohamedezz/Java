# Chapter 1 : Java Fundamentals 

### Protability

Java introduced an important feature that was missed at the time
it's created, which is the portability

Other languages like **c**, and **c++** are designed to compile for a specific machiene (target CPU), and _compilers_ are expensive & time consuming to create

Java is a platform-independent language that is used to create software to be embedded in various electronic devices

### Java & Internet

Java introduced **_applets_**, which is a programs that can be transmitted over the internet & automatically executed (download + run) by _java-compatible browser_ 

Applets are used to display server msgs, or provide simple functionality

> You may have heard about **_servlets_**, as applets runs & provides functionality on the client side, servlets also provide functionalities _but_ on the **_server side_**

### Bytecode

The java compiler doesn't provide executable file as other languages compilers, instead it generates a **_bytecode_**

> Bytecode is an optimized set of instructions executed by java virtaul machine (**_JVM_**)
